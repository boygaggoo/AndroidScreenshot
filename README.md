Android Screenshot
==================

Android Screenshot is a quick tool to take screenshots from an Android device
connected to your computer and save them to the desktop. It works on Mac OSX
(though could be easily ported to other platforms), and requires the Android
SDK to be installed, making this a useful tool for Android developers. Just to
be clear, **Android Screenshot is not a tool to take screenshots from your
phone**.


Installation
------------

To install, uncompress the zipfile and drag the Android Screenshot app to your
/Applications folder. Make sure that your `~/.bashrc` file defines the
environment variable `ANDROID_SDK_HOME`. This variable should be the path to
where the Android SDK has been installed on your Mac.
